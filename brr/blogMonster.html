        <p class="blog_PostPost">In this week's episode of Burning Rock Radio, Ivy and Sam find some creepy paintings in their professor's upstairs hallway. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I've never particularly liked nature art. I mean, it's fine. There are obviously some really great paintings of nature and landscapes out there. I prefer paintings with people, though—or at least paintings with some hint that people exist. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I like paintings of cities, and I like paintings of objects, and I like paintings of cars and buildings and desks. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This episode of Burning Rock Radio takes inspiration from two different scenes in C.S. Lewis' “The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.” 
            <br>
            <br>
            The first scene is the scene in which Lucy has to walk down Coriakin's creepy hallway in order to find a book of spells. The second is the scene in which a painting of a boat turns real, ushering Lucy and her family into Narnia in the first place. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Hallways and paintings and creepy hallways with paintings have always had a special place in my heart. </p>
