        <p class="blog_PostPost">I used to live in a small town in eastern Washington where there's a gas station and convenience store tucked down at the bottom of a hill. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Apparently, it's open all night.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is important because if I had known that it was open all night when I still lived there, I would have gone there at 3 am and bought myself a corn dog and a coffee, and just hung out. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I really like working at night. I like writing and designing stuff and answering emails after midnight. I like sitting in deserted public places and feeling like I can take my time. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I put an all-night convenience store in my podcast because it seems realistic that a gas station would be the only thing open all night in a town like Burning Rock. Plus, I feel like it provides a nice contrast to all the boutique and specialty stores populating the rest of the town. You can only buy so much fancy cheese and chocolate.</p>
